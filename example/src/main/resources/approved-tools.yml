# Approved Tools Configuration (CONFIG_BASED mode)
#
# This file defines which discovered tools are exposed to AI agents.
# Treat this as code: commit to Git, review changes, audit modifications.
#
# Format: List of exact tool names (as discovered from your endpoints)
#
# To discover available tool names:
#   1. Start with approval-mode: MANUAL in development
#   2. Call GET /mcp/admin/tools/discovered to see all discovered tools
#   3. Review and add safe tools to this list
#   4. Switch to approval-mode: CONFIG_BASED for production
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Only approve read-only operations by default
#   - Carefully review any tools that modify data
#   - Never approve delete/destructive operations without explicit approval
#   - Use descriptive comments to explain why each tool is approved
#   - Group related tools together

approvedTools:
  # User read operations - safe for AI agents
  - get_api_users # List all users
  - get_api_users_id # Get single user by ID

  # Product read operations - safe for AI agents
  - get_api_products # List all products
  - get_api_products_id # Get single product by ID

  # Search operations - safe (read-only)
  - post_api_users_search # Search users with filters
  - post_api_products_search # Search products with filters


  # Example of tools NOT approved (dangerous operations):
  # - delete_api_users_id      # ❌ Deletes users
  # - post_api_users           # ❌ Creates users
  # - put_api_products_id      # ❌ Updates products
  # - post_api_orders_refund   # ❌ Refunds money
